The website is ongoing process to deal with architecture issues, user responsive issue, mobile version layout issues. Over years I learned so many lessons and learned to be super patient to solve the problem first, and then look for the opportunity to learn technology and how to make plans for the future version of website development. 

The website was developed start from 2012 August to 2013 March. There were so many challenges coming out in terms of design, understanding webserver, cache, security, and all other issues. 

I experienced the SQL injection attack, web server cache user complaints, mobile website hard to navigate, desktop version issues related to search features, web page time out for slow internet connection, the list goes on and on. 

I do believe that the secret is how fast I can fix the issue, and how strong I can pinpoint the issue and be able to clean up with less code, and also good hard working attitude and self-confidence.
