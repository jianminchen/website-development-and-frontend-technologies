It is the first time I like to write how I meet the daily chanllenge at the work as a frontend developer and also a full stack developer from January, 2015 to Sept. 2018. 

From January 2015, I started to work on Leetcode algorithms and also started to learn various web technologies through pluralsight.com courses. 

Let us take a look at how I practice C# programming on Leetcode first. <br>
[Julia's Leetcode discuss - 50 practices](https://github.com/jianminchen/Leetcode_Julia/tree/master/Leetcode%20discussion)<br>

To learn advanced web architecture, I prepared myself for an onsite interview related to system design in May 2018.

In August 2018, I wrote a case study using object-oriented programming, C#. [Here](https://github.com/jianminchen/Object-oriented-Design/tree/master/Object-Oriented%20Design%20Study%20Case) is the folder containing my exercise. I wrote the code to implement all the functions first, and then will come back to review for better design of object-oriented programming. 

From May to August 2012, a web programmer designed the new front end web page using html, CSS and Javascript and JQuery. 
From August 2012 to January 2013, I wrote ASP.NET, C#, Jquery, CSS and html code, using ASP.NET webform to implement the company website.

From 2015 to 2018, I worked as a software programmer and also designed, developed the website using ASP.NET, JavaScript, Jquery, CSS and Html. 

Case study 1: 
One of requests is to make the website more responsive. When a user moves mouse over the product listed on the website, the user does not know what is difference between those 7 products. In 2016, I decided to add hoverover response, display the lumens for each products. 

I started to learn MVC, Restful API, web service, Angular JS and other web technologies by myself from 2013, and through pluarsight.com from 2016. I spent a lot of time to learn the technologies using pluralsight.com.
