I like to put together some web links and source code to help me answer some of questions, related to web frontend technologies I used, CSS, html, JavaScript, Jquery. I did not have chance to apply Angular.JS and other framework into the work, even though I studied and tried a few times over months, and also took some courses to study them.

From January 2015, I started to work on Leetcode algorithms and also started to learn various web technologies through pluralsight.com courses. 

Let us take a look at how I practice C# programming on Leetcode first. <br>

To learn advanced web architecture, I prepared myself for an onsite interview related to system design in May 2018.

In August 2018, I wrote a case study using object-oriented programming, C#. [Here](https://github.com/jianminchen/Object-oriented-Design/tree/master/Object-Oriented%20Design%20Study%20Case) is the folder containing my exercise. I wrote the code to implement all the functions first, and then will come back to review for better design of object-oriented programming. 

From May to August 2012, a web programmer designed the new front end web page using html, CSS and Javascript and JQuery. 
From August 2012 to March 2013, I wrote ASP.NET, C#, Jquery, CSS and html code, using ASP.NET webform to implement the company website.

From 2012 to 2018, I continued to work as a software programmer and also maintained the website using ASP.NET, JavaScript, Jquery, CSS and Html. 

Case study 1: 
One of requests is to make the website more responsive. When a user moves mouse over the product listed on the website, the user does not know what is difference between those 7 products. In 2016, I decided to add hoverover response, display the lumens for each products.

I started to learn MVC, Restful API, web service, Angular JS and other web technologies by myself from 2013, and through pluarsight.com from 2016. I spent a lot of time to learn the technologies using pluralsight.com.  I continued to spend time to make code more readable and also easy to maintain, I did not have time to rewrite the code using those new technologies I learned to my current work.
